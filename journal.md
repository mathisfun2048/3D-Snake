1AM -> 6AM

Started framing the implementation of the music software. Did not have the internet, so this process took a bit longer than normal. 

This is going to be added to the runtime firmware and does the following:

- adds death sound effect! This makes it easier for the user to know when they died
- adds music to make the game feel less boring
- the above point also helps mask the sound of the motor
